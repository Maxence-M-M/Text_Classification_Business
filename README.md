# Text_Classification_Business
We created an idea of company using Text Classification. 

This fictitious company called VeriText is based on algorithm (in R) which will classify text to facilitate the strenuous data crunching by the legal and compliance teams in banking industry.

Our initial goal was to create an algorythm for the ZINDI Competition : Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Text Classification Challenge. 
After the challenge , we wanted to go deeper and create then a fake company that will provide our Text Classidfication Algorythm and create reports/pitches.
