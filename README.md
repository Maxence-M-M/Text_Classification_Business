# Text_Classification_Business
We created an idea of the company using Text Classification. 

This fictitious company called VeriText is based on an algorithm (in R) that will classify text to facilitate the strenuous data crunching by the legal and compliance teams in the banking industry.

Our initial goal was to create an algorithm for the ZINDI Competition: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Text Classification Challenge. 
After the challenge, we wanted to go deeper and create a fake company that will provide our Text Classification Algorithm and develops reports/pitches of the potential of such a company in the banking sector.
